            <h1 class="heading">Intro to Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a free-to-use and a versatile language, it builds localized and distributed software. </p>
            <h1 class="heading">Basic Definition of Java</h1>
            <p>Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications.
                 It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today.
                  Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading">Variables</h1>
            <p>A variable is a literal assignment to an identifier
                Java variables have a type attached.
            </p>

            <h1 class="heading"> Using final keyword</h1>
            <p>Final means that the variable assigned cannot be changed similar to
               const in Javascript.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Types</h1>
            <p>Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language because, in Java, 
                each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) 
                is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or variables defined 
                for a given program must be described with one of the Java data types.
            </p>
            <dl><h2>Primitive Types</h2>
                <dt>Primitive Types </dt>
                <dd>Primitive types are Number, Strings, and Booleans.
                    There are two special types Null and Undefined.
                </dd>
                <dt>Byte</dt>
                    <dd>The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. The byte data type is useful for saving memory in large arrays.</dd>
                <dt>Short</dt>
                    <dd>The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. Similar to byte, a short is used when memory savings matter, especially in large arrays where space is constrained.</dd>
                <dt>Int</dt>
                    <dd>It is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer. Basically a Number w/o a decimal</dd>
                <dt>Long</dt>
                    <dd>The long data type is a 64-bit signed two’s complement integer. It is used when an int is not large enough to hold a value, offering a much broader range.</dd>
                <dt>Booleans</dt>
                    <dd>boolean data type represents a logical value that can be either true or false. Conceptually, it represents a single bit </dd>
                <dt>Float</dt>
                    <dd>The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit Use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers.</dd>
                <dt>Double</dt>
                    <dd>The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice.</dd>
                <dt>Char</dt>
                    <dd>The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character with the size of 2 bytes</dd>
            </dl>

            <d1><h2>Non-Primitive Types</h2>
                <dt>Strings</dt>
                    <dd>Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string in Java is, that the string is designed to hold a sequence of characters in a single variable whereas, a character array is a collection of separate char-type entities.</dd>
                <dt>Arrays</dt>
                    <dd>An Array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.</dd>
                <dt>Object</dt>
                    <dd>An Object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities.</dd>
                <dt>Class</dt>
                    <dd>A Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type.</dd>

            <h1 class="heading">Expressions</h1>
            <p>Expressions are units of code that can be evaluated and resolve to a value</p>

                <p>Grabing user input can be done by importing scanner object
